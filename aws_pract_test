QUESTION 170 

A university is running an internal web application on AWS that students can access from the university 

network to check their exam results. The web application runs on Amazon EC2 instances and pulls results 

from an Amazon DynamoDB table. Auto Scaling is currently configured to add a new web server when CPU is

QUESTION 307 

During a review of business applications, a Solutions Architect identifies a critical application with a relational 

database that was built by a business user and is running on the user’s desktop. To reduce the risk of a 

business interruption, the Solutions Architect wants to migrate the application to a highly available, multi-tiered 


solution in AWS. 

What should the Solutions Architect do to accomplish this with the LEAST amount of disruption to the 

business? 

A. Create an import package of the application code for upload to AWS Lambda, and include a function to 

create another Lambda function to migrate data into an Amazon RDS database 

B. Create an image of the user’s desktop, migrate it to Amazon EC2 using VM Import, and place the EC2 instance in an 
Auto Scaling group 

C. Pre-stage new Amazon EC2 instances running the application code on AWS behind an Application Load 

Balancer and an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance 

D. Use AWS DMS to migrate the backend database to an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance. Migrate the 

application code to AWS Elastic Beanstalk 

 

 

 

QUESTION 308 

A company has thousands of files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket that has a well-defined access pattern. The 

files are accessed by an application multiple times a day for the first 30 days. Files are rarely accessed within 

the next 90 days. After that, the files are never accessed again. During the first 120 days, accessing these files 

should never take more than a few seconds. 

Which lifecycle policy should be used for the S3 objects to minimize costs based on the access pattern? 

A. Use Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage for the first 30 days. Then move the 

files to the GLACIER storage class for the next 90 days. Allow the data to expire after that. 

B. Use Amazon S3 Standard storage for the first 30 days. Then move the files to Amazon S3 Standard- 

Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) for the next 90 days. Allow the data to expire after that. 

C. Use Amazon S3 Standard storage for first 30 days. Then move the files to the GLACIER storage class for 

the next 90 days. Allow the data to expire after that. 

D. Use Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) for the first 30 days. After that, move the 

data to the GLACIER storage class, where is will be deleted automatically. 

 

 

QUESTION 309 

A company creates business-critical 3D images every night. The images are batch-processed every Friday and require an 
uninterrupted 48 hours to complete.

A. On-Demand Instances 

B. Scheduled Reserved Instances 

C. Reserved Instances 

D. Spot Instances 

 

 

QUESTION 310 

An application generates audit logs of operational activities. Compliance requirements mandate that the 

application retain the logs for 5 years. 

How can these requirements be met? 

A. Save the logs in an Amazon S3 bucket and enable Multi-Factor Authentication Delete (MFA Delete) on the 

bucket. 

B. Save the logs in an Amazon EFS volume and use Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) locking with the 

volume. 


C. Save the logs in an Amazon Glacier vault and use the Vault Lock feature. 

D. Save the logs in an Amazon EBS volume and take monthly snapshots. 

 

 

QUESTION 311 

A Solutions Architect is creating an application running in an Amazon VPC that needs to access AWS Systems 

Manager Parameter Store. Network security rules prohibit any route table entry with a 0.0.0.0/0 destination. 

What infrastructure addition will allow access to the AWS service while meeting the requirements? 

A. VPC peering 

B. NAT instance 

C. NAT gateway 

D. AWS PrivateLink 

 

 

 

 

 

QUESTION 312 

A photo-sharing website running on AWS allows users to generate thumbnail images of photos stored in 

Amazon S3. An Amazon DynamoDB table maintains the locations of photos, and thumbnails are easily recreated 

from the originals if they are accidentally deleted. 

How should the thumbnail images be stored to ensure the LOWEST cost? 

A. Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) with cross-region replication 

B. Amazon S3 

C. Amazon Glacier 

D. Amazon S3 with cross-region replication 

 

 

 

QUESTION 313 

A company is implementing a data lake solution on Amazon S3. Its security policy mandates that the data 

stored in Amazon S3 should be encrypted at rest. 

Which options can achieve this? (Select TWO.) 

A. Use S3 server-side encryption with an Amazon EC2 key pair. 

B. Use S3 server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C). 

C. Use S3 bucket policies to restrict access to the data at rest. 

D. Use client-side encryption before ingesting the data to Amazon S3 using encryption keys. 

E. Use SSL to encrypt the data while in transit to Amazon S3.
